Logic for spin count taking (100 spin count as example).

-click on 100 spin count btn
-at once start extracting the spin count, make custom method without any sleep. Keep extracting until spin count is equal or 1 less than the previous. If spin count is 1 less than the previous, replace value of the initial count by current count and in current count replace the new value. 
-keep that in while loop with the condition that banner image should not be matched 100%.
-Make custom methods for banner trigger, free spin, bonus game, jackpot check with no Thread.sleep() in place.
			free spins, bonus games, jackpot, checks should immediately stop if the image (Mega in jackpot) and in free spins (Free Spin text image)
		
-These methods should trigger only when banner check is true, if not then keep extracting the spin count.
